<p>I have been living here since I was born. It is still going well. However, there are a lot of bugs and cockroaches. And there are a lot of mosquitoes because there is a mountain in front of the house. 
<p>It's still here. </p>

<h3>history</h3>
<p>Let me go back 3 years (2021) before I started this. At that time, I was using a template called site123. </p>
<p>But the template was old and not my style. So I thought I should try HTML too, and I ended up starting. </p>
<p>It's too early to create a website without any knowledge. </p>
<p>So I searched online and pasted it.</p>
<p>I copied and pasted repeatedly.</p>
<p>So this is how it started. Now I just put in the code I know.</p>
<p>I think it's a bit odd to create a student website without any knowledge.</p>
<p>I plan on not doing this later when I learn.</p>
